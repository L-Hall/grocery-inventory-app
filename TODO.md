# Grocery Inventory App - Development TODO

This file tracks the development progress and remaining tasks for the grocery inventory management app.

## Project Status: MVP Foundation Complete âœ…

### âœ… Completed Tasks

- [x] **Set up Firebase project and Firestore database**
  - Created firebase.json configuration
  - Defined Firestore security rules for user data isolation
  - Created database indexes for inventory queries
  - Built database initialization script with sample data

- [x] **Create database schema and security rules**
  - User-based data isolation (users/{userId}/inventory, etc.)
  - Collections: inventory, categories, grocery_lists, purchase_history
  - Security rules prevent cross-user data access

- [x] **Build custom MCP server for Claude integration**
  - Complete TypeScript MCP server in `/mcp-server/`
  - Tools: list_inventory, update_inventory, get_low_stock, search_inventory, create_grocery_list
  - Firebase Firestore integration
  - Natural language processing capabilities

- [x] **Create REST API endpoints with Firebase Functions**
  - Express.js API with Firebase Auth middleware
  - Endpoints mirror MCP server functionality for Flutter app
  - Error handling and validation
  - CORS configuration for Flutter integration

- [x] **Implement OpenAI integration for natural language parsing**
  - Smart grocery text parser with GPT-4 function calling
  - Fallback parsing when OpenAI unavailable
  - Confidence scoring and review recommendations
  - Handles various input formats: "bought 2 gallons milk", "used 3 eggs"

- [x] **Create Flutter app structure and authentication**
  - Feature-based architecture (auth, inventory, grocery_list)
  - Provider state management with GetIt dependency injection
  - Firebase Auth integration
  - Neurodivergent-friendly app theme and design system

- [x] **Create CLAUDE.md documentation for future development**
  - Comprehensive development guide for Claude Code instances
  - Architecture overview and design principles
  - Common commands and environment setup

## ðŸš§ In Progress Tasks

### High Priority - Core Functionality

- [ ] **Build core Flutter screens (input, review, inventory)**
  - Text input screen for grocery lists
  - AI parsing review/confirmation screen
  - Current inventory view with categories
  - Settings screen for API keys and preferences

- [ ] **Test MCP integration with Claude Desktop**
  - Set up Firebase credentials for MCP server
  - Configure claude_desktop_config.json
  - Test natural language commands
  - Verify data consistency between MCP and Firebase

- [ ] **Deploy and test complete system**
  - Deploy Firebase Functions
  - Test API endpoints
  - End-to-end workflow testing
  - Performance optimization

## ðŸ“‹ Next Phase Tasks

### MVP Completion
- [ ] **Authentication screens**
  - Sign in/sign up forms
  - Password reset functionality
  - User onboarding flow

- [ ] **Inventory management features**
  - Manual add/edit items
  - Category management
  - Low stock notifications
  - Search and filtering

- [ ] **Grocery list functionality**
  - Generate lists from low stock items
  - Manual list creation
  - Check off items during shopping
  - History of past lists

### Polish & UX
- [ ] **Error handling and loading states**
  - Network error handling
  - Graceful API failure recovery
  - Loading indicators
  - Offline support

- [ ] **Accessibility improvements**
  - Screen reader support
  - High contrast mode
  - Large text support
  - Voice input options

### Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] **Barcode scanning** (optional enhancement)
- [ ] **Recipe integration** (meal planning)
- [ ] **Shopping analytics** (spending patterns)
- [ ] **Family sharing** (shared inventories)
- [ ] **Store integration** (price comparison)

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus: Core Flutter Screens

The immediate priority is completing the core Flutter UI that will demonstrate the natural language workflow:

1. **Text Input Screen** - Where users paste/type grocery lists
2. **Review Screen** - Confirm AI-parsed items before updating inventory  
3. **Inventory Screen** - View current stock with visual status indicators
4. **Settings Screen** - Configure OpenAI API key and preferences

These screens will prove the core value proposition: seamless natural language inventory updates for neurodivergent users.

## ðŸ”§ Environment Setup Needed

Before testing the complete system:
- [ ] Create Firebase project and add configuration
- [ ] Set up Firebase Functions deployment
- [ ] Configure MCP server with Firebase credentials
- [ ] Add OpenAI API key for natural language processing
- [ ] Test Claude Desktop MCP integration
